# Reflection

There are truely a giant amount of work with a lot of new things to learn.
I believe that the biggest issue is still the time-management on this project. I do have plans and sketches in head about how would I make all these codes into a working software, however, the lack of the management has became major pullback and soon running out of time.

I do have putted a lot efforts in writing the classes and methods, thinking how should each class interact with each other, with the user, and with the file outputs. The final result may seemed to be very crude but for the classes and methods, I built them with a running gui software in head.

For the timeslots and availabilities, I made with a helper TimePoint, which, like the nodes in a linked list, and chaning all the TimePoints into this TimeSlot. As the program grow bigger in size and complexity I really learned the importance of writing comprehensive, informative, concise and descriptive docs to each of the classes and methods. 

Having a plan and sketch in head is one thing, but completing it would be another. I have spent more than 50 hours into this project, however, I still find the pacing is not too well. With the experience of this project, I learned that besides the *sketch in head*, besides knowing what the programs would look like, I should also making sure I know all the detailed points start from planning. Including all the problems that I would encounter, all the functionalities this program will do, and all the dependencies that this program may relying on, and what packages that I don't know and how shoudl I learn them (just reading the publised docs would be enough? or a head-to-toe tutorial would be required for me to master this additional module to use it in the project.) One example is tkinter, I began to trying to make the program with a decent GUI using tkinter, soon enough I realized my knowledge about tkinter has been very distant from enough to make it useful in this project. I spent about ten hours trying to follow a tutorial online on tkinter, however, following tutorials are still very different than making the use of the package in my own project. For a lot parts, I still need to spent many hours online searching for the root cause of some problems. In the end, I have to abort the GUI and making the cmd program in a very very short amount of time.

About time planning, I learned this software development concept of *Scrum and Sprint Planning*, to listing out all the problems and functionalities as issues and working on to close the issues one after another. I did not have a chance to make use of it in this project, but I believe that this is a very helpful concept for me to plan my software developing life cycle in the future.
